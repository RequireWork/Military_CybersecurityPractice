Cryptography basics use basic ciphers that can be divided into two
different forums.

- Simple
- Extremely Complex <- More used compared to simple ciphers

Cryptography = Ensure safety and confidentiality for two parties
that wish to communicate without being understood by a different party.

Ex) Enigma Machine : A type of cipher used during WWII as a way of sending coded messages where it can only be decoded through the use of an actual password for the machines encrypted message sender.

3DES, AES, RSA are all types of keys that are used to sent cryptic messages.

Cryptographic algorithms

(Symmetric and Asymmetric)

Using secret key or shared secret.

[Issues]

Symmetric key encryption does not scale well.

Find users in your computer using cat /etc/passwd


Sending password function:

First

base64 keyfromjohn.key > keyforjohn.send: Encrypts the key in base64 

cat keyforjohn.send|mail -s "For John" john: Send the key to John with the title For John.

su -john: changes the user to a different person!

mail: reads out all the mails that John recieved!

echo "<Whole script>" > keyforjohn.base64: Saves the sent mail as a base64 decryptable key.

base64 -d keyforjohn.base64 > keyfromcybrary.key: Decodes the key to be usable!

echo "<message>" > message.base64: Sends the message into a base64 file

base64 -d message.base64 > message.enc: Decodes the file in base64 format!

openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey keyforjohn.key -in message.enc -out message.txt: Basically the full decrypting!

==================================================================================

Assymetric Cryptography uses a public key and a private key.

public key is widely distributed and used to encrypt messages.

also ensures confidentiality.

Private key can be decrypted by anyone with a public.key

Asymmetric cryptography is more computationally intensive.
